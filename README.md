# fnnmOS-ELM

  <img src="fnnmOS-ELM.jpg" alt="fnnmOS-ELM">

A Python implementation OS-ELM with CNNs or RNNs on some datasets.

## Requirements

* keras
* python >= 3.6


## Usage
  I have applied fnnmos-elm to many datasets, all of which have achieved good results. These datasets include iris, IMDB, cifar-10, cifar-100, MNIST and Boston. You can find the corresponding code in the corresponding directory. 

  In addition, fnnmos-elm needs to have a good pre training model, and I recommend that you use it as an optimizer, for the reasons that can refer to my paper.
